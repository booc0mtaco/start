# Start

This is a re-write of what was hosted on my site at <http://untropy.net/start/>, using new styling, new-ish technology (as well as you can do with JS), and hopefully open to exploration.

This project uses the following tools:

- [Gulp v4](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

### Local Setup

Install the following globally:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:booc0mtaco/start.git
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
$ npm install -g commitizen
$ npm install
```

Once installed, to build, run:

`gulp build`

To develop, run: 

`gulp start`

**Note**: this project will use [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) formatting, so run `git cz` for easy commit message formatting.
